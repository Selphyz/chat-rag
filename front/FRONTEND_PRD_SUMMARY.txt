KEY SECTIONS INCLUDED:
=============================================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   - Overview of the Next.js frontend for RAG chat system
   - Seamless integration with NestJS backend
   - User-friendly interface for authentication, chat, and documents

2. PRODUCT OVERVIEW (2.1 - 2.3)
   - Purpose: User registration, chat management, document handling
   - Target Users: Business professionals, researchers, teams, developers
   - Key Differentiators: ChatGPT-like UI, privacy-first, streaming responses

3. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (3.1 - 3.2)
   - Tech Stack: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, React Query, Styled Components
   - System diagram showing frontend-backend integration
   - API client architecture with JWT token handling

4. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (FR-AUTH-001 through FR-UX-005)
   - Authentication (login, register, session management, profile)
   - Chat Interface (sidebar, message window, input, creation, streaming)
   - Document Management (upload, list, actions, status tracking)
   - User Experience (empty states, loading, errors, responsive, accessibility)
   - Settings (theme, privacy, security)

5. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
   - Performance: < 3s page load, 60fps animations, < 500KB bundle
   - Security: JWT handling, HTTPS, XSS/CSRF protection
   - Reliability: Error recovery, data consistency, browser support
   - Maintainability: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, test coverage

6. PAGE STRUCTURE & ROUTING
   - Complete route map with protected routes
   - Authentication routes: /auth/login, /auth/register
   - Protected routes: /chat, /documents, /profile
   - 404 error handling

7. COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE
   - Layout components (MainLayout, AuthLayout)
   - Page components (LoginPage, ChatPage, DocumentsPage, ProfilePage)
   - Reusable components (Message, FileUpload, Loading, Toast, etc.)

8. STATE MANAGEMENT
   - Server State: React Query for chat, documents, user data
   - Client State: Context API for auth, UI, chat UI state
   - Queries and mutations defined

9. API INTEGRATION
   - API client setup with JWT injection
   - Request/response interceptors
   - Endpoints mapped (authentication, chat, documents, health)
   - Error handling strategy

10. FORM VALIDATION
    - Login form: email, password
    - Register form: email, password, confirmation, terms
    - Document upload: file type and size validation

11. STYLING & DESIGN
    - Complete design system (colors, typography, spacing, border radius)
    - Component styling with Styled Components
    - Responsive breakpoints: Mobile, Tablet, Desktop

12. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
    - Environment variables for app, API, features
    - Build configuration for dev/prod

13. DEVELOPMENT PHASES (6 weeks)
    Phase 1: Setup & Authentication
    Phase 2: Chat Interface
    Phase 3: Chat Functionality
    Phase 4: Document Management
    Phase 5: Polish & Optimization
    Phase 6: Testing & Deployment

14. SUCCESS CRITERIA
    MVP Requirements: 10 checkboxes for core functionality
    Quality Metrics: 7 checkboxes for performance and quality
    User Experience: 3 checkboxes for usability

15. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
    Phase 2: Dark mode, export, search, sharing, shortcuts
    Phase 3: Document preview, vector viz, memory, model selection
    Phase 4: File storage, collaboration, voice, web search

16. RISKS & MITIGATIONS (8 risks identified)
    - Backend downtime
    - Upload failures
    - Token expiration
    - Mobile UX issues
    - Slow LLM responses
    - Browser compatibility
    - Authentication failures
    - State management bugs

17. DEPENDENCIES
    - Core Framework: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5.9
    - Form: react-hook-form, zod validation
    - State: @tanstack/react-query
    - Styling: styled-components
    - Dev Tools: ESLint, TypeScript types

18. GLOSSARY
    - 10 key terms defined (JWT, SSE, REST, SPA, RAG, etc.)

19. UI/UX FLOW DIAGRAMS
    - Registration & Login Flow
    - Chat Interaction Flow
    - Document Upload Flow

20. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA EXAMPLES
    - User Login story with scenarios
    - Send Message story with scenarios

21. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
    - Frontend: Code splitting, image optimization, memoization
    - Network: Bundle size, gzip, caching, CDN
    - Runtime: Avoiding re-renders, hooks, virtualization

22. TESTING STRATEGY
    - Unit Tests: Components, hooks, utilities (70% coverage)
    - Integration Tests: API flows, authentication
    - E2E Tests: Full user journeys
    - Performance Testing: Lighthouse, Core Web Vitals
